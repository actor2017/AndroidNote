Kotlin 实现的 View to View 动画效果库

Usage

First you need to create a Transitioner object containing your original and ending views:

val transition = Transitioner(original_view, ending_view)
The view pairs must have matching "tag" attributes so that they can be bound together:

<ConstraintLayout
        android:id="@+id/original_view"
        android:tag="constrView"
        ...>

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/text"
            android:tag="firstView"
            .../>
</ConstraintLayout>

<ConstraintLayout
        android:id="@+id/ending_view"
        android:tag="constrView"
        android:visibility="invisible"
        ...>

        <EditText
            android:id="@+id/text3"
            android:tag="firstView"
            .../>
 </ConstraintLayout>
I recommend you hide the second view layout, since it's only used as a placeholder for the end destination. The views can be of any type, you can mix and match them, the two layouts can have a different number of views and nested layouts are 100% supported. The only things to keep in mind are:

all views which you would want to match together must have the same tag attribute in both layouts

all unmatched views will remain at their original place inside the original layout

the second layout is just a placeholder. It doesn't hold any logic, it only shows where the original layout should move to.

Basic Usage

 transition.setProgress(0.5f)
 //or
 transition.setProgress(50)
Additional methods and tweaks

transition.duration = 500

transition.interpolator = AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator()

transition.animateTo(percent = 0f)

transition.onProgressChanged {
//triggered on every progress change of the transition
    seekBar.progress = (it * 100).toInt()
    }
    
val progress: Float = transition.currentProgress
